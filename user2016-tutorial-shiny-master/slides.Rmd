## Warm up: Side effects



---

Functions can be executed for one or both of the following reasons:

> 1. You want its return value.
> 2. You want it to have **some other effect**.

<div class="fragment">
These are (a bit misleadingly) called _side effects_. Any effect that is not the return value is a side effect.
</div>



## Functions with side effects

```r
write.csv(...)

plot(cars)

print(x)

httr.POST(...)

alarm()
```



## More side effects

```r
# Sets a variable in a parent environment
value <<- 10

# Loads into global env by default
source("functions.R")

# Modifies the global search list
library(dplyr)

# Only if foo is an env, ref class, or R6
foo$bar <- TRUE
```



## NOT side effects (when inside a function)

```r
# Modifying *local* variables
value <- 10

# Creating most kinds of objects
list(a = 1, b = 2)

# Data frames are pass-by-value in R so this is OK
dataset <- dataset %>% filter(count > 3)

# Most calculations
a + 1
summary(pressure)
lm(speed ~ dist, data = cars)
predict(wfit, interval = "prediction")
```



## Ehhh... Not side effects

```r
# Reading from disk
readLines("data.csv")

# Making HTTP GET requests
httr.GET("https://api.example.com/data.json")

# Reading global variables
.Random.seed

# Modifying the random seed... ehhhhhh...
runif(10)
```



If executing your function/expression **leaves the state of the world a little different** than before it executed, **it has side effects**.

But if "what happens in `func`, stays in `func`" (besides the return value), then it doesn't have side effects.



## Side effect quiz

For each function, write Yes if it has side effects, and No if not.



## Question 1

```r
function(a, b) {
  (b - a) / a
}
```



## Question 2

```r
function(values) {
  globalenv()$values <- values
  values
}
```



## Question 3

```r
function() {
  options(digits.secs = 6)
  as.character(Sys.time())
}
```



## Question 4

```r
function(df) {
  df$foo <- factor(df$foo)
  df
}
```



## Question 5

```r
function() {
  readLines("~/data/raw.txt")
}
```



## Question 6

```r
function(values) {
  hist(values, plot = TRUE)
}
```



## Question 7

```r
function() {
  # Create temp file, and delete when function exits
  filePath <- tempfile(fileext = ".png")
  on.exit(file.unlink(filePath))

  # Plot to the temp file as PNG image
  png(filePath); plot(cars); dev.off()

  # Return the contents of the temp file
  readBin(filePath, "raw", n = file.info(filePath)$size)
}
```



## Answers

1. No
2. Yes
3. Yes
4. No
5. No
6. Yes
7. Mostly no



---

**Side effects make code harder to reason about,** since order of execution of different side-effecty functions can matter (in non-obvious ways).

**But we still need them.** Without side effects, our programs are useless! (If a program executes but has no observable interactions with the world, you may as well have not executed it at all!)



## Reactive programming

<div class="notes">
Reactivity can be your best friend—or your worst enemy. If you follow some rules of the road, and trust them, then you'll end up moving in the right direction.

We haven't been very upfront about these rules; mostly I've disseminated them in replies to shiny-discuss threads. So even if you've been following Shiny development pretty closely, it's quite likely that some of the things I'll discuss today will be news to you.

One of my top priorities in 2016 is to get the message out there about how to use reactivity properly, and it starts right here, at this conference, in this tutorial. So your feedback is *most* welcome after the tutorial.

You ignore these principles at your peril! The temptation is especially strong among smart, experienced programmers. Resist it—at least until you've tried to do it the right way first. These aren't rules that people say but don't expect anyone to completely follow, like "write unit tests for every function", "floss after every meal", etc. These are more like, "bring your car to a stop when you come to a stop sign".

If you've tried to do it the right way and still really want to break these rules, email me at joe@rstudio.com and let's talk about it. But please, do that before sinking weeks or months into your app, while I can still help you!

## Ladder of Enlightenment

1. Made it halfway through the tutorial. Has used `output` and `input`.
2. Made it entirely through the tutorial. Has used reactive expressions (`reactive()`).
3. Has used `observe()` and/or `observeEvent()`. Has written reactive expressions that depend on other reactive expressions. Has used `isolate()` properly.
4. Can say confidently when to use `reactive()` vs. `observe()`.
5. Writes higher-order reactives (functions that have reactive expressions as input parameters and return values).
6. Understands that reactive expressions are monads.

<div class="notes">
I'd like to propose a ladder of Shiny reactivity "enlightenment".

Take a moment to read this list, then discuss with the people around you where you currently rank. Don't be shy or embarrassed if you're at level one or two, we're all here to learn! Go ahead, I'll give you two minutes.

How many of you feel like you're at levels one or two?

How many are at level three?

How many are at level four?

Anyone besides Hadley and Winston at five or six?

So at level three, you can write quite complicated applications. And many of you have. This is a dangerous zone. Your apps generally work, but sometimes you struggle with why things are executing too much, or not enough. Each new feature you add to your app seems to increase the overall complexity superlinearly.

Our goal today is to get everyone, or at least most of you, to level four. When you have a firm grasp on the reactive primitives we've built into Shiny, you can build complicated networks of reactive expressions and observers, with confidence. Combine that knowledge with the new modules feature, which Garrett will talk about tomorrow, and you've got all the tools you need to write large yet maintainable Shiny apps.

Level five or six is where the real fun begins. We won't get there today, but if you're interested in learning more, please let me know! I'd love to talk to you. Maybe we can organize a group vchat or webinar or something, and eventually spin that in to an article or three.

## Exercise 0

Open `Exercise_00.R` and complete the server function. Make the plot output show a simple plot of the first `nrows` rows of a built-in dataset.

You have 3 minutes!

Hint: `plot(head(cars, nrows))`

<div class="tip">

</div>

<div class="notes">
We'll get started with a really basic example app, just to get the juices flowing a little bit.

Open up Exercise_00.R; it should be in your Files pane. You should see the beginnings of a Shiny app. The UI definition is complete, but the server function is blank. I want you to fill in that server function. Make the plot output show a simple plot of the first `nrows` rows of a built-in dataset of your choice. If you can't think of any, use `cars`.

So basically, make the Shiny equivalent of this: `plot(head(cars, nrows))`

I'll give you five minutes. That might be way too much time for some of you, but it'll give us a chance to shake out any technical issues. If you need help, talk to your neighbors, or flag down one of the TAs or myself. If you have extra time, get to know your neighbors a little more.
</div>




## Solution

``` 
output$plot <- renderPlot({
  plot(head(cars, input$nrows))
})
```

<div class="notes">
OK, we're back. Hopefully your code looks something like this.

How many of you ended up with this answer? Anyone come up with something different?

What we don't want is something like this:
</div>



## Anti-solution

``` 
observe({
  df <- head(cars, input$nrows)
  output$plot <- renderPlot(plot(df))
})
```

<div class="notes">
This pattern of putting renderPlot inside of an observe, usually means the author has a fundamental misconception of what it means to assign a render code block to an output slot.
</div>



---

`output$plot1 <- renderPlot(...)`

> - **DOESN'T mean:** "Go update the output `"plot1"` with the result of this code."
> - **DOES mean:** "This code is the _recipe_ that should be used to update the output `"plot1"`."

<div class="notes">
Historically, we've asked you to take it on faith that whenever `input$nrows` changes, any dependent outputs, reactive expressions, and observers will do the right thing. But how does Shiny know how the code is related? How does it know which outputs depend on which inputs, reactives, etc.?

There are really two possibilities: _static_ analysis, where we'd examine your code, looking for reactive-looking things; and _runtime_ analysis, where we'd execute your code and see what happens.

We do the latter. Shiny just executes your code and sees what happens. It eavesdrops to see what reactive values (like `input`) or reactive expressions your output reads, and whatever it reads is considered a "dependency". Any changes to one of those dependencies means the output is considered out-of-date, or "invalidated", and might need to be re-executed.
</div>



## Takeaway {.takeaway}

### Know the difference between telling Shiny _to_ do something, and telling Shiny _how to_ do something.



## Reactive expressions

<div class="fragment">
**Expressions** that are **reactive** <span class="fragment">(obviously)</span>
</div>

> - **Expression:** Code that _produces a value_
> - **Reactive:** _Detects changes_ in anything reactive it reads



---

```r
function(input, output, session) {
  # When input$min_size or input$max_size change, large_diamonds
  # will be notified about it.
  large_diamonds <- reactive({
    diamonds %>%
      filter(carat >= input$min_size) %>%
      filter(carat < input$max_size)
  })
  
  # If that happens, large_diamonds will notify output$table.
  output$table <- renderTable({
    large_diamonds() %>% select(carat, price)
  })
```



---

```r
  ... continued ...

  # Reactive expressions can use other reactive expressions.
  mean_price <- reactive({
    mean(large_diamonds()$price)
  })
  
  # large_diamonds and mean_price will both notify output$message
  # of changes they detect.
  output$message <- renderText({
    paste0(nrow(large_diamonds()), " diamonds in that range, ",
      "with an average price of $", mean_price())
  })
}
```



---

```r
function(input, output, session) {
  
  # This DOESN'T work.
  large_diamonds <- diamonds %>%
    filter(carat >= input$min_size) %>%
    filter(carat < input$max_size)
  
  output$table <- renderTable({
    large_diamonds %>% select(carat, price)
  })
}
```

`large_diamonds` would only be calculated once, as the session starts (i.e. as the page first loads in a browser).



## Exercise 1

Open up the file `Exercise_01.R`.

There's a new `tableOutput("table")` in ui.R. Have it show the same data frame that is being plotted, using `renderTable`.

**Make sure that the `head()` operation isn't performed more than once for each change to `input$nrows`.**

You have 5 minutes.

## Solution

```r
function(input, output, session) {

  df <- reactive({
    head(cars, input$nrows)
  })
  
  output$plot <- renderPlot({
    plot(df())
  })
  
  output$table <- renderTable({
    df()
  })
}
```



## Anti-solution 1

``` 
function(input, output, session) {

  values <- reactiveValues(df = cars)
  observe({
    values$df <- head(cars, input$nrows)
  })
  
  output$plot <- renderPlot({
    plot(values$df)
  })
  
  output$table <- renderTable({
    values$df
  })
}
```



## Anti-solution 2

``` 
function(input, output, session) {

  df <- cars
  observe({
    df <<- head(cars, input$nrows)
  })
  
  output$plot <- renderPlot({
    plot(df)
  })
  
  output$table <- renderTable({
    df
  })
}
```

<div class="notes">
Let's forget about that last one, since it doesn't work. What about the previous two? Let's talk about what they do. The first one uses a reactive expression to store the calculation. The second one creates a reactive values object and uses an observer to keep the value up-to-date. Who prefers the first approach? Who prefers the second?

So we mostly agree that the first approach is superior. But why? It might feel like I'm just setting up strawmen, but I see this kind of code all the time on the shiny-discuss mailing list. It seems obvious when we lay it bare with a minimal example like this, but in the context of a more complicated app, it can be much trickier.

We shouldn't take the second approach—but *why* shouldn't we take it? What's the first-principles reason to avoid this kind of code? We need some first-principles to build from so we can confidently answer these questions. You should be able to confidently answer these questions by the end of the tutorial.
</div>



## Takeaway {.takeaway}

### Prefer using reactive expressions to model calculations, over using observers to set (reactive) variables.



## Exercise 2

Open up the file `Exercise_02.R`.

This is a working app--you can go ahead and run it. You choose variables from the iris (yawn) data set, and on various tabs it shows information about the selected variables and fits a linear model.

The problem right now, is that each of the four outputs contains copied-and-pasted logic for selecting out your chosen variables, and for building the model. Can you refactor the code so it's more maintainable and efficient?

You have 5 minutes.

<div class="tip">
Just joining us? Go to http://user2016.joecheng.com/signup/ to grab an RStudio Server account, where you'll find these slides and the exercise files.
</div>

## Solution

```r
selected <- reactive({
  iris[, c(input$xcol, input$ycol)]
})

model <- reactive({
  lm(paste(input$ycol, "~", input$xcol), selected())
})
```

<div class="notes">
Here's what we've got: two reactive expressions, one of which depends on the other (`model` calls `selected()`).

This is the cool thing about reactive expressions: they _compose_.

(show diagram)

If you think of Shiny apps as network graphs, then reactive values (like inputs) form one kind of leaf node; outputs and observers form another kind of leaf node; and reactive expressions are the nodes in the middle that can form arbitrarily deep links.

**Ctrl-F3** Once we have this beautiful (ok, not that beautiful, we're going to work on it...) graph, Shiny can use it to optimize its calculations. It's a little-known fact that Shiny outputs generally "know" when they're not visible on the page, and suspend themselves. When they do that, they no longer cause reactive expressions to execute (because reactive expressions are _lazy_).

In this case, we don't have to perform the model fitting unless and until a different tab is selected.

## Anti-solution

  # Don't do this!
  
  # Introduce reactive value for each calculated value
  values <- reactiveValues(selected = NULL, model = NULL)
  
  # Use observers to keep the values up-to-date
  observe({
    values$selected <- iris[, c(input$xcol, input$ycol)]
  })
  
  observe({
    values$model <- lm(paste(input$ycol, "~", input$xcol), values$selected)
  })
```

<div class="notes">
We lose those advantages when we use observers and reactive values. The reactive graph doesn't actually give you a good picture of the relationships between inputs, outputs, and calculations. Shiny is severely hindered from helping us make this app more efficient.
</div>



## Takeaway {.takeaway}

### Seriously, prefer using reactive expressions to model calculations, over using observers to set (reactive) variables.



## Observers



---

Observers are blocks of code that **perform actions**.

They're executed in response to changing reactive values/expressions.

They don't return a value.

```r
observe({
  cat("The value of input$x is now ", input$x, "\n")
})
```



## Observers come in two flavors

> 1. **Implicit:** Depend on _all_ reactive values/expressions encountered during execution.  
`observe({...})`  
&nbsp;
> 2. **Explicit:** Just depend on _specific_ reactive value/expression; ignore all others. (Also known as "event handler".)  
`observeEvent(eventExpr, {...})`



---

```r
function(input, output, session) {

  # Executes immediately, and repeats whenever input$x changes.
  observe({
    cat("The value of input$x is now ", input$x, "\n")
  })
  
  # Only executes when input$upload_button is pushed. Any reactive
  # values/expressions encountered in the code block are treated
  # as non-reactive values/expressions.
  observeEvent(input$upload_button, {
    httr::POST(server_url, jsonlite::toJSON(dataset()))
  })
}
```



## Exercise 3

Open `Exercise_03.R`.

Add server logic so that when the `input$save` button is pressed, the data is saved to a CSV file called `"data.csv"` in the current directory.

You have 5 minutes!

<div class="tip">
Just joining us? Go to http://user2016.joecheng.com/signup/ to grab an RStudio Server account, where you'll find these slides and the exercise files.
</div>

## Solution

```r
# Use observeEvent to tell Shiny what action to take
# when input$save is clicked.
observeEvent(input$save, {
  write.csv(df(), "data.csv")
})
```



## Reactive expressions vs. observers



## `reactive()`

> 1. It **can be called** and **returns a value**, like a function. Either the last expression, or `return()`.
> 2. It's **lazy**. It doesn't execute its code until somebody calls it (even if its reactive dependencies have changed). Also like a function.
> 3. It's **cached**. The first time it's called, it executes the code and saves the resulting value. Subsequent calls can skip the execution and just return the value.
> 4. It's **reactive**. It is notified when its dependencies change. When that happens, it clears its cache and notifies it dependents.



---

```r
function(input, output, session) {
  reactive({
    # This code will never execute!
    cat("The value of input$x is now ", input$x, "\n")
  })
}
```



---

```r
r1 <- function() { runif(1) }
r1()
# [1] 0.8403573
r1()
# [1] 0.4590713
r1()
# [1] 0.9816089
```

<div class="fragment">
```r
r2 <- reactive({ runif(1) })
r2()
# [1] 0.5327107
r2()
# [1] 0.5327107
r2()
# [1] 0.5327107
```
</div>



---

The fact that reactive expressions are **lazy** and **cached**, is critical.

<div class="fragment">
It's **hard to reason about** when reactive expressions will execute their code—or whether they will be executed at all.
</div>

<div class="fragment">
All Shiny guarantees is that **when you ask a reactive expression for an answer, you get an up-to-date one**.
</div>



## `observe()` / `observeEvent()`

> 1. It **can't be called** and **doesn't return a value**. The value of the last expression will be thrown away, as will values passed to `return()`.
> 2. It's **eager**. When its dependencies change, it executes right away.
> 3. (Since it can't be called and doesn't have a return value, there's no notion of caching that applies here.)
> 4. It's **reactive**. It is notified when its dependencies change, and when that happens it executes (not right at that instant, but ASAP).



---

`reactive()`          `observe()`
--------------------- ---------------------
Callable              Not callable
Returns a value       No return value
Lazy                  Eager
Cached                _N/A_

<div class="notes">
Don't worry, there won't be a quiz on this. All of this is to point the way towards the two things you _do_ need to remember.

This next slide is the reason I wanted to have this conference in the first place.

Are you ready?
</div>



---

- `reactive()` is for *calculating values, without side effects*.

- `observe()` is for *performing actions, with side effects*.

<div class="notes">
This is what each of these is good for. Do not use an `observe` when calculating a value, and especially don't use `reactive` for performing actions with side effects.
</div>



---

A **calculation** is a block of code where you don't care about whether the code actually executes—you just want the answer. Safe for caching. **Use `reactive()`.**

An **action** is where you care very much that the code executes, and there is no answer (return value), only side effects. **Use `observe()`/`observeEvent()`.**

<div class="fragment">
(What if you want both an answer AND you want the code to execute? Refactor into two code chunks--separate the calculation from the action.)
</div>



---

                  `reactive()`    `observe()`
----------------- --------------- ---------------
**Purpose**       Calculations    Actions
**Side effects?** Forbidden       Allowed



## An easy way to remember

<span class="fragment">Outside of your reactives</span>

## Takeaway {.takeaway}

### Use reactive expressions for calculations (no side effects). Use observers for actions (side effects).

## Other topics

- `eventReactive` - `observe` : `observeEvent` = `reactive` : `eventReactive`
- `isolate` - Blocking reactivity
- `reactiveValues` - Used in concert with `observe`/`observeEvent`, when you can't model your app logic using the reactive graph
- `invalidateLater` - Time-based reactivity (and so much more)
- `validate` and `req` - Elegant mechanisms for dealing with missing inputs and failed preconditions
- `shinySignals` - Higher order reactives by Hadley



## Checking preconditions with `req()`

Sometimes a computation depends on inputs or values that may or may not be available.

- Needs user to make a choice for which no reasonable default exists
- Depends on data that must be uploaded by the user
- Reads an input that doesn't initially exist as part of the page, but rather, is part of a `uiOutput`

See `req_v1_broken.R`



## Naive solution: `return(NULL)`

**Check for these conditions (mostly using `is.null()` or `== ""`) and `return(NULL)`**

This works, but now everyone that reads this reactive must also check for `NULL` and return early, and so on, layer after layer...

See `req_v2_badfix.R`



## Can we do better?

When we detect an unmet precondition, we don't really want to return a `NULL` result; it makes more sense to treat it like an error:

`stopifnot(!is.null(input$dataset))`

Except that for these cases, we don't want red error messages in the UI, and we don't want observers to panic due to uncaught exceptions.



## Correct solution: Use `req()`

`req()` is like a custom version of `stopifnot` that:

1. Doesn't show an error message in Shiny, and doesn't cause observers to panic
2. Performs some common "truthy/falsy" tests to save you some typing (see `?req` for details)

See `req_v3_goodfix.R`



## Coming soon

- Bookmarkable state
- Database improvements and best practices
- `insertUI`/`removeUI`
- Modal dialogs and notifications
- Automatically reconnect on grey-out (opt-in)
- reactlog now shows elapsed time for reactive expressions and observers 
- Better looking `tableOutput`



## `insertUI`/`removeUI`

New functions that complement `uiOutput`/`renderUI`.

    - `uiOutput` populates a div reactively (`renderUI`); each invocation of the `renderUI` code *replaces* the entire div.
    - `insertUI` is used to *add* new UI to the page; nothing is removed or replaced.
    - `removeUI` removes specific HTML elements from the page.

Makes some types of apps much easier to code. ("How do I implement an 'Add plot' button?")

Demo: `shiny::runApp("insertui.R")` (try uploading `iris.csv`)



## Shiny and databases

- Q: “Can Shiny apps use databases?”  
A: “Uh, obviously... it’s just R...”
- But there is a difference between using databases interactively, and using them in deployed apps
  - Managing database connections
  - Handling potentially malicious input safely
- The solution is part code, part public service announcements (see new "Databases" section of [shiny.rstudio.com/articles](http://shiny.rstudio.com/articles))



## SQL injection

```r
query <- paste0(
  "SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = '",
  input$id,
  "';")
dbGetQuery(conn, query)
```

(It's just a SELECT query; could go wrong?)

## Use interpolation

```r
query <- sqlInterpolate(conn,
  "SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ?id;",
  id = input$id)
dbGetQuery(conn, query)
```

If you ever find yourself `paste`-ing together SQL queries, alarm bells should sound in your head!

By using `sqlInterpolate`, you're protected against SQL injection.

(Still better are _prepared statements_---coming to DBI soon!)



## Bookmarkable state

- Allow users to interact with an app, then “snapshot” the resulting state as a URL that can be bookmarked or shared
- One of the longest-standing feature requests in Shiny
- Custom solutions built by many people in many ways over the years, but surprisingly hard to generalize
- Our solution is informed by prior work by Vincent Nijs ([radiant](https://github.com/vnijs/radiant)) and Andrzej Oleś ([shinyURL](https://github.com/aoles/shinyURL))



## Bookmarkable state

- Natively integrated into Shiny—cleaner syntax, better user experience, more robust restore logic
- Highly configurable
  - Automatic save/restore of inputs; manual save/restore of custom values and/or filesystem data
  - Either **encode** these values directly in (long/ugly) URL, or **persist** them on the server and return a short URL with an ID
- Currently on a branch (wch/shiny@bookmarkable-state) for testing; hopefully landing on master within two or three weeks



## Preparing your app

1. Wrap your UI in function(req):  
```r
ui <- function(req) {
  fluidPage(...)
}
```
2. Add `saveStateButton()` to UI
3. In server function, call `configureBookmark(...)`
4. If necessary, provide your own callback functions to customize saving/restoring behavior



## Bookmarkable state demo

`shiny::runApp("bookmark.R")`



## Deploying

- For `configureBookmark(type="persist")`, server support is necessary
- Shiny Server, Shiny Server Pro, and RStudio Connect support coming this summer
- ShinyApps.io support TBD (can still use encode mode)
